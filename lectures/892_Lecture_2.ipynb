    "## Part 1: Introduction to Git and Basic Commands on Google Colab\n",
    "\n",
    "### History of Git\n",
    "Git was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 out of a need for a distributed version control system that could handle large projects and was not reliant on a central server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Git:\n",
    "1. **Distributed System**: Every user has a complete local copy of the repository, allowing for full functionality and history viewing even when offline.\n",
    "2. **Branching and Merging**: Git's branching and merging capabilities are swift and straightforward, promoting parallel development without conflicts.\n",
    "3. **Data Integrity**: Git uses a cryptographic method (SHA-1) to keep track of changes ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "4. **Speed**: Git operations are fast, optimizing performance.\n",
    "5. **Collaboration**: Git platforms like GitHub and GitLab provide tools for collaboration, code review, and issue tracking.\n",
    "6. **Open Source**: Git is free and open source.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Public vs. Private Repositories:\n",
    "- **Public Repositories**:\n",
    "  - Accessible to everyone.\n",
    "  - Anyone can clone, fork, or view the content, but not everyone can push changes unless given permission.\n",
    "  - Great for open-source projects where collaboration from the community is encouraged.\n",
    "- **Private Repositories**:\n",
    "  - Access is restricted to users who have been granted permission.\n",
    "  - Ideal for proprietary projects, sensitive information, or academic assignments where you don't want solutions to be publicly accessible.\n",
    "  - Platforms like GitHub offer private repositories even in their free tier.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Key Commands (for now):**\n",
    "- `git clone`: Clones a repository from a remote source.\n",
    "- `git stash`: Stashes changes in without losing them.\n",
    "- `git pull`: Pulls changes from a remote repository."

    "\n",
    "IMPORTANT: If you get stuck - read this [page](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-use-google-colab-with-github-via-google-drive-68efb23a42d) and follow the instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "From now on I'm not going to share individual notebooks with you but rather the class repository. You will need to clone the repository to your Google Drive and then open the notebooks from there. To do so you must follow the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open your Google Drive page and create a new folder called \"git_projects\" (or whatever you want to call it) in your `My Drive` folder.\n",
    "2. Go to Google Colab and create a new notebook and call it `project_setup.ipynb`.\n",
    "3. Mount your Google Drive by running the following code in the first cell of your notebook:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from google.colab import drive\n",
    "   drive.mount('/content/drive')\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "4. Set your working directory to the folder you created in step 1 by running the following code in the second cell of your notebook:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/git_projects/\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "5. Clone the class repository by running the following code in the third cell of your notebook:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   !git clone https://github.com/jancgreyling/AE_772_892.git\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- This step will clone the repository and create a folder called `AE_772_892` in your `git_projects` folder.\n",
    "6. Open the `AE_772_892` folder in your Google Drive and navigate to the `Lectures` folder and open the notebook for this lecture. You can open it in Google Colab by right-clicking on the notebook and selecting `Open with` and then `Google Colaboratory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note the following:**\n",
    "- You only need to do this once. From now on you can open the notebooks directly from your Google Drive.\n",
    "- Once you've created your repository, you cannot clone it again, if want the get update it with the latest changes, you can do so by running the following code in a cell in your notebook:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   !git pull\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "- VERY IMPORTANT:\n",
    "   - You can only run the above code if you are in the correct directory. If you are not in the correct directory, you will get an error. To change your directory, you can run the following code:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      %cd /content/drive/MyDrive/git_projects/AE_772_892/\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "   - YOU NEED TO DO THIS AT THE START OF EACH LECTURE TO GET THE LATEST NOTEBOOKS.\n",
    "   - If you've made changes to the notebooks, you will get an error when you try to pull the latest changes. You will need to commit your changes first. We will discuss this in more detail in the next lecture. For now you can stash (move to a separate branch) your changes by running the following code:\n",
    "      ```python\n",
    "      !git stash\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "- Note that you need to refresh your Google Drive tab in Google Colab to see the changes you've made to the repository.\n",
    "   ![Figure 3](/Images/refresh.png)\n",
    "- Note that when a repo is cloned, or initialised, it contains a set of hidden git folders. When you open the repo in Google Drive, and you see these folder, DO NOT DELETE THESE FOLDERS. If you do, you will break the link between your Google Drive and the GitHub repository.\n",
    "- For this reason you you can only `stash` and `pull` code if you are in the correct directory. If you are not in the correct directory, you will get an error. To change your directory, you can run the following code:\n",

   "source": [
    "See lecture 1 for a recap of logical statements, this is the pandas implementation thereof\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use dataframe logical statements to select specific rows.\n",
    "  - Example to filter records where age is greater than 20:\n",
    "    ```python\n",

    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down what is happing step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **`df['age']`**: This part of the code selects the 'age' column from the DataFrame `df`. The result is a pandas Series containing all the values in the 'Age' column.\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. **`df['age'] > 20`**: This is a conditional operation that's applied to the 'age' Series. It will return another Series of the same length, but instead of ages, it will contain boolean values    \n",
    "    (`True` or `False`). A value will be `True` if the corresponding age is greater than 20, and `False` otherwise. For example, if `df['age']` contains `[18, 21, 19, 22, 25]`, then `df['age'] > 20` will \n",
    "    return `[False, True, False, True, True]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  3. **`df[...]`**: The outer `df[...]` is used to index (or select) rows from the DataFrame `df`. When you use a boolean Series to index a DataFrame like this, pandas will select all rows that \n",
    "    correspond to `True` values in the boolean Series. Using our earlier example, only the rows with ages 21, 22, and 25 will be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "  4. **`filtered_data = ...`**: The result of the above operations, which is a subset of the original DataFrame with only the rows where age is greater than 20, is then assigned to the variable \n",
    "    `filtered_data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, the logic of `filtered_data = df[df['age'] > 20]` is: \"From the DataFrame `df`, give me a new DataFrame (`filtered_data`) that only contains rows where the value in the 'Age' column is greater than 20.\"\n"

    "\n",
    "- When using `loc` with a single bracket (like `df.loc[2]`), it'll return a Series representing that row. If you want it as a DataFrame, use a double bracket (like `df.loc[[2]]`).\n",

    "- The end value in a range specified in `loc` (like `df.loc[1:3]`) is **inclusive**, which is different from Python's standard slicing where the end value is exclusive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always ensure the values you're using within `loc` match the data type of the index. If the index is of string type, use string values, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Be careful when modifying slices. You're directly modifying the original DataFrame unless you explicitly work on a copy.\n"

    "## Comparing `loc` and `iloc` for DataFrame Filtering in Pandas\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Distinctions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Range End Inclusion**: In `iloc`, the end value of a specified range is exclusive, aligning it with Python's standard slicing syntax. On the other hand, `loc` includes the end value in the range.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Indexer Types**: `iloc` only accepts integer-based indexers or integer arrays. In contrast, `loc` permits label-based indexers and boolean conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output Format**: When using either `loc` or `iloc` with a single bracket (e.g., `df.loc[2]` or `df.iloc[2]`), the result is a Series. To obtain a DataFrame instead, employ double brackets (e.g., `df.loc[[2]]` or `df.iloc[[2]]`).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Indexing Order**: Both `loc` and `iloc` follow a row-first, column-second ordering scheme, which deviates from Python's native column-first, row-second pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basis for Indexing**: `loc` employs label-based indexing, while `iloc` relies on integer-location based indexing.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Permissible Indexers**: `loc` accommodates both labels and boolean conditions, offering greater flexibility. In contrast, `iloc` is more rigid, requiring integer values or integer arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Inclusion of Range End Value**: `loc` incorporates the end value in a range, whereas `iloc` excludes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Flexibility and Constraints**: `loc` provides more versatility in indexing by accepting labels and boolean conditions. `iloc`, being more restrictive, accepts only integers."
